Mojave is a desktop game board and development / debugging tool for Battlesnake (see https://play.battlesnake.com). It aims to bring an immersive "arcade" style experience to the game, with crisp neon visuals, an electrifying soundtrack, and a high amount of customizability.

Don't know Battlesnake? It's an online programming game played by developers from all over the world! Build a snake "bot" and be the last one slithering on the game board to win. You can use any language or technology that implements a web server. For more information on how to write your snake, and on the rules of the game, take a look at the Battlesnake docs (see https://docs.battlesnake.com/).

Battlesnake's mission is to make programming fun and accessible for everyone! With Mojave, we hope to make your Battlesnake experience even better!

For full game rules, see the official Battlesnake Rules at https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/rules , the following is an abridged version:

Standard
Under Standard rules, snakes may freely roam the game board, and lose some health on each turn. Food will spawn periodically on the game board. Eating food will restore a snake to full health, but will cause it to grow by one tile. A snake will die if it runs out of health, runs into a wall, or into the body of itself or another snake. If two snakes have a head-on-head collision, the smaller snake will be killed (and both will be killed if they are the same size).

Royale
Under Royale rules, the edges of the board will slowly fill with hazards. If the head of a snake enters a hazard, that snake will take damage at an increased rate.

Squads
Under Squads rules, all snakes are assigned to one of up to four squads. Snakes that belong to the same squad will share health and length, and may pass through each other's bodies without dying. However, if a snake dies, all other snakes on that squad will die as well.

Constrictor
Under Constrictor rules, there is no food on the board. Instead, snakes will grow on every turn, with their tail locked to their starting position. This is also known as a Tron game.

Wrapped
Under Wrapped rules, if a snake crosses the edge of the board, instead of being killed, it will re-enter the board from the opposite edge.

Custom
Custom games make use of a pre-set template to pre-place food, hazards, and snakes at the start of the game. They are played using Standard rules, however, hazard damage can be customized in a manner similar to Royale games.
